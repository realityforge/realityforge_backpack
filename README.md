# Realityforge Project Management

This repository helps manage the realityforge repositories using Backpack. Backpack is a very
simple tool that helps you manage GitHub organizations declaratively. See the vendored 
[README](vendor/tools/backpack/README.md) for a basic overview of the tool.

The simple instructions are update the file `backpack_config.rb` and converge via:

    $ ./backpack
